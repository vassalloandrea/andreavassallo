**Search Engine Results Page** coverage means dominating search results by combining organic rankings and paid ads. When our business appears both in organic results and in PPC ads for the same search, we take up more screen space that users see. 

This visual monopoly dramatically increases the chance that users will click on our links instead of competitors' links, because our brand appears multiple times and dominates the results page. 

The goal is to work on both strategies in parallel, organic and paid, to maximize our overall visibility.
