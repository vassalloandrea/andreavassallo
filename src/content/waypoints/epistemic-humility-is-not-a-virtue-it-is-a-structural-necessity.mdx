The mind cannot function without excluding almost everything. This is not a technical limit you can overcome with more study or more experience — it is built into how consciousness works. You always pick a handful of sand from an infinite beach.

This means that anyone who claims to have a complete view of something — a market, a person, a situation — is unconsciously mistaking their handful for the whole beach.

Humility here is not a moral choice. It is the only honest response to how perception actually works.

This is the epistemic consequence of You are not what you perceive, you are how you select. Both [[Radical Empiricism]] and [[Kant Empiricism concept]] point here too, from different starting points.
