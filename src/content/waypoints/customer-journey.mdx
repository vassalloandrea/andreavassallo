The **Marketing Funnel** — also known as the **Customer Journey** — is the model that describes the path a potential customer takes from their very first contact with a brand all the way through to purchase and beyond. It is represented as a funnel because, as people move from the **upper funnel** to the **bottom funnel**, a portion of them drop off along the way: not everyone who discovers a brand will end up buying.

In an e-commerce context, the funnel breaks down into three macro-areas: the **upper funnel**, where the goal is to generate awareness and bring new people to discover the brand; the **mid funnel**, where the goal is to nurture interest and help people evaluate the brand as the right solution to their problem; and the **bottom funnel**, where the goal is to convert, retain, and maximize customer value over time.

Each phase requires deeply different initiatives, messages, and success metrics. And this is precisely where a complementary and essential model comes into play: the **[[Schwartz Awareness Levels]]**.
