Kant states that all knowledge begins with experience, which is the starting point or input of knowledge, but it is not the only source. 
The human mind possesses forms and categories a priori, such as space, time, and causality, that structure sensory data to make it intelligible. This introduces universal and necessary elements to knowledge, like synthetic a priori judgments. 

In detail, all knowledge starts with experience because we cannot know anything without sensory input from the external or internal world and this concept is linked with the [[Radical Empiricism]] concept. 

However, it does not follow that all knowledge derives entirely from experience. Our mind is not a passive blank slate but an active organizer. It applies innate lenses, the a priori forms of sensibility and the categories of understanding, to raw experiential data, giving them form and meaning. For example, we see a red object through experience, but the fact that every event has a cause does not come from experience but is a rule our mind imposes to understand the world. 

This idea is fundamental to Kant's criticism because it seeks to resolve the debate between [[Radical Empiricism]], which claims all knowledge comes from experience, and rationalism, which claims reason has innate ideas, by proposing a synthesis where experience provides the matter but the mind provides the form.
