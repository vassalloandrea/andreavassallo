Your identity is not shaped by what surrounds you, **but by the filter you use to process it**. The selection process is not a neutral tool — it is built from your history, fears, desires, and values. Two people in the same room, in the same conversation, live radically different experiences not because the world is different, but because they carry different filters.

Identity, then, is not a fixed essence inside you. It is a recurring pattern of selection that persists over time.

This also means that changing who you are is not about changing the world around you — it is about becoming aware of, and gradually shifting, the way you select from it.

If identity is a filter, then every filter is also a blind spot — see [[Epistemic humility is not a virtue, it is a structural necessity]].
