Schwartz's awareness levels describe five progressive stages a potential customer goes through on their journey to purchase.  
  
The first level is complete unawareness, where the person doesn't even know they have a problem or that a product exists to help them.  
  
In the second level, problem awareness, the customer recognizes they have a need or difficulty but doesn't yet know that solutions are available.  
  
At the third level, solution awareness, they know there are ways to solve their problem but don't know specific products or how they work.  
  
In the fourth level, product awareness, the customer knows your product but isn't yet convinced it's the best choice for them.  
  
Finally, in the fifth level, full awareness, the customer knows the product and wants to buy it but might need one last push to complete the action.  
  
For an effective marketing strategy, it's essential to create targeted content for each of these five levels, because each stage requires different messages and approaches to guide the customer toward the purchase decision.
