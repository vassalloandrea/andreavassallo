Welcome. My name is **Andrea Vassallo**, and this is my Atlas.
## What is this Atlas
This is my digital garden — a living, interconnected knowledge base where I organize and solidify everything I learn and think about across my core disciplines: **team leadership**, **e-commerce strategy**, **software architecture**, and **fullstack engineering**.

It is, in many ways, my digital identity. Not a portfolio, not a blog. It is how I think, what I care about, and where I am headed — made visible.
## Who I am
I am a Software Engineer and Tech Lead at [**Nebulab**](https://www.nebulab.com "https://www.nebulab.com"), working with ambitious DTC and e-commerce brands to solve complex technical and strategic problems.

My strength is connecting technical architecture to business outcomes. I sit at the intersection of the dev team and the client — not just writing code, but understanding _why_ we are building what we are building and making sure every technical decision serves a real business goal. I am, at my core, a consultant.

But no bio can fully capture how someone thinks. If you want the real picture, browse the [waypoints](/waypoints "/waypoints"), explore the connections, and let this Atlas speak for itself.
## Why an Atlas
Reading is not enough. You can consume hundreds of articles, books, and case studies, but if you never stop to structure what you have absorbed, most of it stays buried at the subconscious level — felt but never fully grasped.

This Atlas is my way of pulling those ideas to the surface. It forces me to take the concepts that would otherwise remain vague intuitions and turn them into something concrete, connected, and reusable. Writing here is how I move from _I think I understand this_ to _I know I understand this_.

Every waypoint in this space exists on a spectrum — some are freshly planted seeds (called sketch), others are well-developed frameworks. All of them are connected, because the problems I work on do not exist in isolation. E-commerce strategy informs software architecture. Leadership decisions shape technical outcomes. Everything links.
## Interested in my work?
If what you find here resonates — whether you are looking for a technical partner for your e-commerce business, exploring ideas around engineering leadership, or simply want to exchange perspectives — I would be glad to connect.

## Credits & Acknowledgments

This project started as a fork of the digital garden built by [**Alessandro De Santis**](https://alessandro.codes). The core architecture of the site is his — I've reworked the design and added my own content, but the technical foundation remains his work.

If you're curious about how this kind of space is built, check out his [colophon](https://alessandro.codes/colophon).

Alessandro's digital garden was the spark that inspired me to build this Atlas. Thank you, Alessandro.
