My personal website and digital garden called Atlas.

## Overview

This is a static website built with modern web technologies that serves as both my personal website and digital garden - a place where I cultivate and share my thoughts and knowledge through interconnected notes and essays.

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:4321

## Credits & Acknowledgments

This project is a fork/clone of the digital garden built by [Alessandro De Santis](https://alessandro.codes). While I've modified and extended it to suit my own needs, the core architecture is entirely his work.
